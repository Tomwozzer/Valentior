			Valentior is a text based adventure game written in Java. It was developed by Tom Warren. It is still being developed.
			It is meant to be an in depth game, with rich features, many dialog options, many outcomes and is continually testing the player
			The world of valentior is a fantasy / medievil game. It features turn based combat with the ability to choose armour sets
			and weapons. You may also choose from a wide variety of weapons and spells. There are 3 Classes; Mage, Warrior and Rougue.
			We will touch more on these later on. Finally, every decision matters in valentior, steal in a town and get caught? now the people
			dont like you... Want to make ammends, help somebody in need and the population will react better towards your presence.
			Overall the game is whatever you make it, so make it a good one. Currently there is no save feature, I am working on that
			as i know that it is a very important aspect to any games.
